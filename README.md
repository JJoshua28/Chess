# Getting Started with Create React App

# Chess

## Challenge One outline:

This repo is my solution for a multiplayer Chess game.

For a simplistic and intuitive interface, I used React. I adhered to oriented programming, using principles like Polymorphism and  I have used object oriented principles to deliver functionality to the end user. To get an MVP out, I have decided to work using an agile approach. This is my preferred method because it simplifies things for me and allows me to be more efficient with my mind focused on the task at hand.

I split the main issues into task below to get an MVP out:

1. Generate a Chess Board
2. Create Chess Pieces
3. Add movement functionality to the chess pieces
4. Enforce Chess pieces to move according to their given type
5. Build functionality that only allows one set of pieces to move at a time
6. Blocking a piece from moving if the tile is occupied by one of its own pieces
7. Blocking a piece from moving past a piece (unless its a horse)
8. Build checkmate functionality
9. Prevent a user from moving a piece if it causes them to be in checkmate
10. Add castling functionality
11. Build functionality to check when a game is over using the checkmate functionality

I have also refactored my code during different points to keep things tidy, following good code principles etc. DRY, low coupling and high cohesion. 

I have also designed Objects which will help with the games functionality. 

Improvements: 

With the latest release, once the page is refreshed the game is reset because there is no server. Ideally, the next re

Below are improvements I would like to implement at some point in the future:

1. Server
2. Game menu
3. Online multiplayer
4. Displaying pieces removed from the game for each player
5. Online chat service
6. Piece and board customisation

I would also like to implement an AI to play against the user or even itself. With that, I may implement AIs with varying difficulties.
